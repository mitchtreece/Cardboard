## Cardboard

Cardboard is a modal-card presentation & customization system built with speed and simplicity in mind

### Basic Usage

Getting started with Cardboard is dead simple:

*CustomCardView.swift*
```swift
import UIKit
import Cardboard

class CustomCardView: CardContentView {
    ...
}
```

CustomViewController.swift
```swift
import UIKit
import Cardboard

class CustomViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {

        super.viewDidAppear(animated)

        Card.default(CustomCardView())
            .present(from: self)

    }

}
```

You just make a custom content view, and present it!

### Customization

Cardboard comes with some built-in style options:

- **default**: a standard bottom slide-up card
- **system**: a card styled like the iOS 13 pop-up cards (i.e. AirPods nearby card)
- **notification**: a top slide-down notification card
- **toast**: a bottom slide-up toast card
- **alert**: a centered alert-style card.

But of course, the styling doesn't stop there! Cardboard has a robust customization system that you can abuse to your heart's content ðŸ¤ª

```swift
let view = CustomCardView()

Card(view) { make in

    make.anchor = .top
    make.statusBar = .lightContent
    make.contentOverlay = .color(.black.withAlphaComponent(0.8))
    make.corners.roundedCornerRadius = 32

}
.present(from: self)
```

You like one of the builin styles but want to slightly tweak it? Cardboard has you covered:

```swift
let view = CustomCardView()

Card.notification(view) { make in

    make.anchor = .bottom
    make.corners.roundedCornerRadius = 8

}
.present(from: self)
```

You can adjust almost every aspect of a card, right down to what kinds of interactions you want it to support ðŸŽ‰
